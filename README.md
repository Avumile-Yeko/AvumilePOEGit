**DATE:** May 2, 2025
## Brief overview of work done in part 2

For PART  2 
I added CSS styling to the website. 
I added an external style sheet which helped with consistency with the layout of the website. 
I linked the external stylesheet to the 6 pages, Home, About, Products & services, Contact Us, Enquiries and FAQ pages. 
I styled the navigation bar in such a way that the buttons are positioned more to the top right corner and the logo of the company on the top left corner
I added more comments to the code as was instructed in the feedback of Part 1. 
I also added a header and a footer to the pages to make them seem more professional and aesthetically pleasing 

# Responsive Design Update ‚Äì Breakpoint Implementation

**Date:** May 4, 2025

## Overview

To improve the scalability and responsiveness of the website across different devices, I analyzed the existing CSS (`Stylesheet.css`) to identify key breakpoints‚Äîscreen 
widths where the layout or usability begins to degrade. Based on this, media queries were added to ensure a better user experience on phones (including a 6.74" device) 
and tablets (8‚Äì10" screens).

---

## üìê How I Found the Breakpoints

I used the following process:

1. **Manual testing in Chrome DevTools:**  
   From a quick google search it told me that I needed to simulate screen sizes from desktop down to smaller phones in Chrome DevTools 
   
2. **Layout stress points:**  
   I observed where content like navigation bars, grid cards, and padding began to overflow, collapse, or appear poorly spaced.

3. **Device targets:**  
   Based on typical screen sizes, I focused on:
   - ‚â§ 768px (tablet)
   - ‚â§ 480px (mobile)

---

## üìã Media Query Implementation

I added CSS media queries targeting:

### **Tablet Devices (‚â§ 768px):**
- Adjusted `.navbar` and `.nav-links` to stack vertically.
- Reduced padding on `.content`.
- `.card` components set to take more horizontal space individually.

### **Mobile Devices (‚â§ 480px):**
- Scaled down font sizes and button padding.
- Converted navbar and nav items to single-column layouts.
- Further reduced top padding to improve vertical fit.

---

## ‚úÖ Results

The website now adapts correctly to:
- Mobile phones (~6.74") with smaller screen widths
- Tablets (8‚Äì10") with medium screen widths
- Desktop and larger screens

This ensures an optimized experience across devices, improves readability, and maintains the structure and design integrity of the website.

## Part 1 corrections on proposals
I corrected my main proposal as instructed on the comments of my part 1. I added a design and user experience, adding the fonts, grid cards, background colors and background images. 
I also fixed the sitemap and made the about section with the rest of the pages. 
I referenced the information, both intext and full referencing Havard style. 
I also added a new reference for the mission and vision statements

## Part 3 

## ** Improvement from feedback received from part 2** 
I Added images on my products and services page and these images will be a visual representation of what we offer at ZeroFive-10 Technologies. 

## Part 3 Additions

1. I created a JavaScript file, an external JS file, that was meant to make the website more interactive, I added animations and made the cards on the websites appear in an animated style. 

2. I added a back to the top button just before the footer of the website

3. I added a "Date modified" on the footer, which houses a date that automatically adjusts. I also integrated the external JS file to the 6 main pages. 

4. I added images to the products and services. Images that show what we offer at the IT store

5. I added Meta tags to the pages for better Search engine optimization SEO

6. I created a sitemap for the website. I tried to download an extension that would debugg the sitemap but nothing worked so I will just trust that the sitemap is good. 

7. I created another page. This is the page that the user will be redirected to when they fill out the enquiry form. This page follows the same style and form of the main pages and all it will show is "Thank you. Our dedicated team will contact you within 24 business hours

8. I changed some of the background images of the Home and About Us page because they made it hard to read the text on the pages. I changed it to some darker images. 

9. I added a typewriter style animation to the pages. This made the main headings appear like their being typed out when you open the pages. I had to embedd the JS for this part into each of the pages instead of put it into the external JS file.

10. In order the optimize the loading speeds of the website, I made sure that the images I used in the pages are not too big in terms of their megebyte sizes, this helps the website operate more faster and smoothly. 
I also made sure the images use a modern format like .webp instead of jpeg. webp images use less space as compared to jpg.

11. To increase the security of the website I added a meta tag that will protect the website from being used in phishing attacks. It does this by preventing the site from being embedded in an iframe. 
<meta http-equiv="X-Frame-Options" content="DENY">
I also added a meta tag that is called content security policy (CSP) which is used to stop cross-site scripting attacks

Because the website will be collecting data (Enquiries.html), the website would need to validate on client-side using JS. It would also need to validate and sanitize on server-side. Furthermore, it would need to prevent SQL injection or email header injection. 

My website will not allow any file uploads because that compromizes the safety of the website as we would have to scan each individual file for malware.
