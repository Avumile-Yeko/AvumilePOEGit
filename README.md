## Brief overview of work done in part 2

For PART  2 
I added CSS styling to the website. 
I added an external style sheet which helped with consistency with the layout of the website. 
I linked the external stylesheet to the 6 pages, Home, About, Products & services, Contact Us, Enquiries and FAQ pages. 
I styled the navigation bar in such a way that the buttons are positioned more to the top right corner and the logo of the company on the top left corner
I added more comments to the code as was instructed in the feedback of Part 1. 
I also added a header and a footer to the pages to make them seem more professional and aesthetically pleasing 

# Responsive Design Update ‚Äì Breakpoint Implementation

**Date:** May 4, 2025

## Overview

To improve the scalability and responsiveness of the website across different devices, I analyzed the existing CSS (`Stylesheet.css`) to identify key breakpoints‚Äîscreen 
widths where the layout or usability begins to degrade. Based on this, media queries were added to ensure a better user experience on phones (including a 6.74" device) 
and tablets (8‚Äì10" screens).

---

## üìê How I Found the Breakpoints

I used the following process:

1. **Manual testing in Chrome DevTools:**  
   From a quick google search it told me that I needed to simulate screen sizes from desktop down to smaller phones in Chrome DevTools 
   
2. **Layout stress points:**  
   I observed where content like navigation bars, grid cards, and padding began to overflow, collapse, or appear poorly spaced.

3. **Device targets:**  
   Based on typical screen sizes, I focused on:
   - ‚â§ 768px (tablet)
   - ‚â§ 480px (mobile)

---

## üìã Media Query Implementation

I added CSS media queries targeting:

### **Tablet Devices (‚â§ 768px):**
- Adjusted `.navbar` and `.nav-links` to stack vertically.
- Reduced padding on `.content`.
- `.card` components set to take more horizontal space individually.

### **Mobile Devices (‚â§ 480px):**
- Scaled down font sizes and button padding.
- Converted navbar and nav items to single-column layouts.
- Further reduced top padding to improve vertical fit.

---

## ‚úÖ Results

The website now adapts correctly to:
- Mobile phones (~6.74") with smaller screen widths
- Tablets (8‚Äì10") with medium screen widths
- Desktop and larger screens

This ensures an optimized experience across devices, improves readability, and maintains the structure and design integrity of the website.
